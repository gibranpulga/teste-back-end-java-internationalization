Test for Java Back-end Developer - Internationalization

Hi ! 
We designed this test to better understand how you approach problems solving, and how you like to code. We try to get as close as possible to our reality, using technologies that we use and that tutorials can easily be found on the internet.
If you are unable or don't want to do one of the requirements, no problem. We will not disqualify you for that. In that case you can comment on it and tell why you skipped. 
We hope you enjoy it!

Below are the tasks. 
Some of the tasks are considered as bonuses, if you do not have time or prefer not to do, you can comment on how you would do or how the technical architecture would be:

- Create an API for an internationalization service. Use Spring BOOT;
- This API must contain the name of all countries in the world and their respective cities;
- Names must be internationalized. At least 5 languages: English, Spanish;
- DB can be at will (suggestion h2, postgres or mongo);
- Add swagger. Tip: document all fields;
- Do not forget the unit tests;
- Deliver the repository link in private mode (gitlab preference) with readme.MD with instructions on how to run locally and technical summary.

- Bonus: add also the postal code (Postal code or Zip code);
- Bonus: add also Portuguese, German, French;
- Bonus: Create dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml to deploy locally as a docker container;
- Bonus: Deploy in some cloud provider (preferably AWS, can be in EC2, or Azure or Heroku);
